### 👩🏻‍🦱🇨🇴 Hi there 👋 Hola!

I am Lina Perez! Welcome to my GitHub! I am a data analytics professional, and I recently completed a Master of Science in Business Analytics at San Francisco State University. I have more than 5 years of experience in Data Analysis where I helped companies in Colombia to make decisions based on data. I am looking for positions in Data Science or Data Analysis. I can't wait to put into practice what I have learned at grad school!
